Some icons I made for my boox Nova Air 2.

# How to install (Nova Air 2)
Drop the icons into `Download/Onyx/icon`

Please ensure that:
1. probably use Gimp, as that's what I used
2. Line width is set to `4` for consistency (I used this with the `Stroke Path` option using the `Path` tool)

If I have a need to make more icons for my ereader, I'll probably put them up here too

Recommended to also check out the other [boox-icons](https://github.com/danbee/boox-icons) repo for more icons! (I am unaffiliated with that repo)

Note: There may be some overlap icons between my repo and theirs. My icons were custom made by me, and specifically for the Nova Air 2, even if it looks similar.
